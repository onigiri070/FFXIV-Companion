*A Twitch and Discord companion module for use with PhantomBot*  

---

### Installation

1. Download this repository and unzip. Copy and paste the *scripts/* folder into your PhantomBot directory.  
*Note: You should not be prompted to replace anything. If you are, place the files in their respective directories, individually.*
2. Start PhantomBot and enable the module.

### Usage

***Changing Regions***  
`!xivregion {NA | EU | JP}` - Changes the region the bot uses to perform server-specific searches and Lodestone URL generation. Valid regions are NA, EU, and JP. Using `!xivregion` alone will display the current region.  

***Searching for Characters***  
`!findchar {first} {last} {server}` - Performs a search for the specified character and returns a Lodestone profile URL if successful. Requires the character's first name, last name and server name.

There is much more on the way. The ultimate goal of this project is to create a comprehensive solution to the majority of FF XIV needs in both Twitch chat and Discord servers.
